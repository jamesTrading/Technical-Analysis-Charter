# Technical-Analysis-Charter
This will be the technical analysis charter for identifying buy and sell price opportunities.
The buy program works based on a joint indicator of MFI being below 30 and MACD being close to a crossover.
The sell part of the program works with MFI over 73 and MACD looking to cross down soon.
The final visuals show the green dots as buy indicators the buy and yellow dots as different sell indicators.
